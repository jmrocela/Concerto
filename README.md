# Concerto is a Fresh & New Premium Wordpress Theme Framework for everyone.

* Note that this project was made with Wordpress 3.0 at the time of completion. Code is still working up until present.

Everyone can build on Concerto, be it developers, designers or even the average blogger. It works on all major browsers and has support for standards based HTML5 or the widely accepted xHTML. Extensibility, Customizability and just plain Easy, that's what Concerto aims to bring. Your Wordpress Harmony.

Concerto is perfect for everyone. Developers can take advantage of the various hooks, filters and even custom APIs within the framework.
